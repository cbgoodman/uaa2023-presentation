.font150[Do overlapping local governments further segregate metropolitan areas?]

---

## Reasons for segregation 

.font120[
1. Individual preferences
2. Income sorting
3. Local government policy
]

---

## Local government policy â†’ segregation

- Following Trounstine (2018, 2020), residents use restrictive land use regulations to limit housing production
- They do so to,
  - Maximize house prices
  - Minimize tax burdens
  - Ensure high quality public services
- This has the effect of reinforcing segregation

---

## Overlapping governments

- Commonly, special districts 
  - Administratively and fiscally independent from other local governments
  - Typically provide a single service (*specialization*)
  - Can choose their boundaries (*territorial flexibility*)
- Measured as the ratio of special districts to non-overlapping general-purpose local governments

---

## How do overlapping governments help segregate metropolitan areas?

- In light of "imperfectly restrictive" land use regulations, special districts can achieve much of what municipalities can
  - Specialized service provision can provide high quality public services
  - Such public services capitalized positively into house prices
  - By limiting service provision to within (homogenous) district, between parcel subsidies are minimized, keeping tax burden low
- Overlapping governments can mimic restrictive land use regulations
- Conditioned on residents having the knowledge to create special districts
  - Patterns of political involvement (white, male, homeowners) suggest the knowledge exists

## Sample construction 

- Period: Census years, 1980 - 2010
- Units: SMSAs (1983 definition)
  - 309 PMSAs & NECTAs
  - To ensure outward growth of MSA does not influence results
- Data: Census of Population & Housing; Census of Governments

## Measuring segregation

Theil (1972) index based on entropy,
$$E = \sum_{r=1}^R (\pi_r)\text{ln} \frac{1}{\pi_r}$$
Where $\pi_r$ is the proportion of racial group $r$

Segregation is measured as the deviation of $E$ from a larger geographic aggregation of $E$, weighted by population.
$$\begin{split}
H_{c{\_}t} & = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{P_t}{P_c} \left( \frac{E_c - E_t}{E_c} \right) \\
H_{m{\_}c} & = \sum_{c=1}^C \frac{P_c}{P_m} \left( \frac{E_m - E_c}{E_m} \right)
\end{split}$$


---

## Measuring segregation

As explained by Trounstine (2018), Theil's $H$ index, calculated as the deviation of neighborhood diversity from metropolitan diversity, can be decomposed into the deviation between cities $(H_{m{\_}c})$ and a weighted average of within-city deviations. 

$$H_{m{\_}t} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{P_t}{P_m} \left( \frac{E_m - E_t}{E_m} \right) = H_{m{\_}c} +\sum_{c=1}^C \left( \frac{P_c}{P_m} \right) \left( \frac{E_c}{E_m} \right) H_{c{\_}t}$$

Overall $(H_{m{\_}t})$ and between-city $(H_{m{\_}c})$ segregation form the two dependent variables for this analysis.

---

## Identification strategy
<br />

$$\begin{split}
SEG_{it} & = \beta_{ij} + \beta_2 DEMO_{it} + \beta_3 RHET_{it} + \beta_4 DENSITY_{it} + \beta_5 GROW_{it} \\ 
& + \beta_6 \widehat{OVERLAP}_{it} + \phi_i + \tau_t + \varepsilon_{it} 
\end{split}$$

- $DEMO_{it}$ = Black-white demographic characteristics
- $RHET_{it}$ = Measures of racial heterogeneity
- $DENSITY_{it}$ = SMSA population density
- $GROW_{it}$ = Annualized population growth 
- $\widehat{OVERLAP}_{it}$ = Predicted jurisdictional overlap
- $\phi$ = state FE, $\tau$ = common time effect, $\varepsilon$ = typical error term

---

## Instruments

Concern that segregation leads to more overlapping governments.

Exploit exogenous variation in local geography to instrument for overlapping governments 
1. Mean slope (degree from horizontal)
2. Miles of river segments (of segments at least 3.5 miles)

<br />

$$\begin{split}
OVERLAP_{it} & =  \beta_{ij} + \beta_2 DEMO_{it} + \beta_3 RHET_{it} + \beta_4 DENSITY_{it} + \beta_5 GROW_{it} \\
& + \beta_6  SLOPE_i + \beta_7  RIVERS_i + \phi_i + \tau_t + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{split}$$

## Discussion

- Using the all-county sample (most similar to Berry 2008), overlap increases own-source revenue and/or property tax revenue per capita
  - Even after controlling for potentially binding TELs
- Using the border-county sample, these results disappear
  - Better control group
  - Sign on interaction is indicative of circumvention (though statistically significant)
